# Advent of Code 2023

This repository contains solutions for [Advent of Code 2023](https://www.adventofcode.com) in Java, wrapped into a [NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org) project. There is a simple starter script that allows you to run the solution for a certain day and, optionally, on a certain input:
```
./aoc.sh <day> [<input>]
```
Note that day needs to be double-digit even when below 10 and the input file is expected to reside in the corresponding source folder for that day. The default input is my actual input for the given day.
